# Hotel Review Score Prediction

## Description
This project aims to predict hotel review scores based on various features of hotels. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest regression model, the project analyzes the relationships between hotel characteristics and their corresponding review scores.

## Features
- Analysis of strong feature pairs with correlation greater than 0.7.
- Data preprocessing to prepare features for model training.
- Implementation of a Random Forest regression model to predict hotel review scores.
- Evaluation of model performance using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from the following link: [Hotel Reviews Dataset](<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sf-booking/data>).

## Installation

To run this project, make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required libraries using pip with the requirements.txt file:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Download the dataset from the link provided above and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook included in this repository.
3. Run the code cells sequentially. The notebook contains all the necessary code for loading the dataset, preprocessing it, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
